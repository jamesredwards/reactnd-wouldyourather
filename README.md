# React Nanodegree Would You Rather Project

Source code submission for the Udacity React Nanodegree programme.

Starter code available here: https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-would-you-rather-starter

## Requirements

npm or yarn

## Installation

1. Clone this repo
2. Run `yarn install` or `npm install`
3. Run `yarn start` or `npm start`
4. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/ if browser window doesn't automatically open

### Notes
1. Existing questions and answers are provided through _DATA.js.
2. Due to the way this "backend" is setup, added questions will not persist between sessions and attempting to navigate directly to the added question url will result in being asked to login again and then a 404 page.
3. Avatar icons source from the React Nanodegree Chirper App.
